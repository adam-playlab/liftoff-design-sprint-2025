          The LifeLab Learning Experience

          Our learning experience is designed to prepare young people for life
          by blending reflection, knowledge-building, real-world application,
          and community. Students move through three interconnected learning
          modes—LifeLab, Core Experiences, and Customized Experiences—each
          offering new insights about who they are and what they can do.

          We encourage students to try new things on, step outside their comfort
          zones, celebrate failure as part of growth, and reflect on lessons
          learned. Every experience—successes, challenges, and discoveries—feeds
          back into their LifeLog, which evolves as their skills, interests, and
          identities develop. Together, these components help young people
          understand themselves, build essential skills, explore opportunities,
          and take purposeful steps toward their future, growing intellectually,
          socially, and personally as they navigate an ever-changing world.

            As students move through each part of the learning experience, they
            earn badges that are recorded in their LifeLog. Bursts can lead to
            Foundations Badges for new knowledge; Forum discussions can earn
            Reasoning & Dialogue Badges; Learning Labs unlock Skills-in-Action
            Badges for applied work; and Life Lab yields Purpose & Planning
            Badges as students refine their goals. Through Community &
            Connection, students earn Belonging & Leadership Badges, while
            Exploration experiences and Credentials award Experience and Mastery
            Badges tied to real-world work and advanced learning. Together,
            these badges build a portfolio that shows what students know, what
            they can do, and who they are becoming.
